The Rock-Paper-Scissors game is a simple command-line game where you play against the computer. You can choose between "rock," "paper," or "scissors," and the computer will randomly select one of these options as well. The game then determines the winner based on the traditional rules:

Rock crushes Scissors
Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
If both you and the computer select the same option, the game is a tie.
